# Introduction {#intro}

This works gathers some notes about maximum likelihood inference in probabilistic model involving the well known Gaussian autoregressive process.

The main motivation for this work was the inference aroung discretely observed integrated Ornstein Uhlenbeck process in movement ecology. 

The book starts by describing this movement model in ecology and the different configurations relative to it. Then, succesive chapters build the different models by adding different bricks. 
The objective is to show how the inference can be performed for each model.
